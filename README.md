# Sequential Search and Binary Search
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive starting point for understanding and implementing two fundamental search algorithms: Sequential Search and Binary Search. These search algorithms are implemented in Python and serve as a great introduction to search techniques for beginners and intermediate programmers.

## Purpose of This Repository

### Sequential Search
Sequential Search, also known as Linear Search, is a basic search algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until the desired element is found or the list ends. This repository provides examples of how to implement and use sequential search in Python.

### Binary Search
Binary Search is a more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the target value to the middle element of the list. This repository includes examples of how to implement and use binary search in Python.
